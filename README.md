# Kniwwelino-WebApps #

This project is an expansion of the Kniwwelino project by [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.list.lu). 
A link to the [Kniwwelino&reg;](https://github.com/LIST-LUXEMBOURG/KniwwelinoLib) GitHub project. 

This library adds a very basic webpage to the Kniwwelino, which can be used to turn on LEDs, change the color of the RGB-LED onboard and write text from the webpage to the Kniwwelino's 5x5 matrix. The page is built from templates upon bootup that are stored on the device itself. This project can be expanded by adding/modifying the included templates and adjustments in the code.

This project was a University project and will thus likely not get any updates in the future, unless I feel the need/motivation to do so.

## Special thanks
Special thanks to the Kniwwelino team at LIST for the help they provided to successfully create this project.
